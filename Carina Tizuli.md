# Description
Tiefling Bard
Carina stands a short 1.4m in contrast with her twin. She is the sister [[Tizuli twins]]. What she seems to lack in sharpness she more than makes up for in enthusiasm and friendliness. When she sings the world comes come to a stop and all those that hear her listen with rapt attention and eventual cheers. She is particularly well known as a singer to the deaf. Through the aid of her bardic magic and technique she is able to transmit sound directly through a person’s bones; allowing the deaf to ‘hear’.

She leads the band bouncing across the stage. Her energy is infectious and even the most boring of scenes is transformed by her jovial performance. She will often imbue a little magic into her voice that drives sales at the bar; though never enough to be rude to those sensitive to the mystical.

Her naivety is endearing but often lands her in trouble. Her brother [[Ozmar Tizuli]] is often vexed by this behavior but has learned to find opportunity in the mishaps.
# Appearance

It is impossible to ignore Carina's hypnotic eyes; shifting color as she sings they draw all in. A matching set of nails shift in sync and prove a magical sight when the lights are off.

Every day she wears her hair in a new way, regularly getting it recolored. Her short purple smooth horns are often hidden in or below the plats of her choice. Similarly, the labyrinth of jewelry on her ears is only seen in glimpses during her performances or on those occasions where she wears her hair up.

The pumps she wears compensate for her stature and are always accompanied by a glittering ensemble of thrifty clothes. Her style is as chaotic and bubbly as her personality.
# Notes
- Though she is aware that the troop serves the [[Cult of the Dragon]], she knows little to nothing about it.
- She was promised that the dragon queen would grant her a singular wish and she would be able to sing the dead temporarily out of their slumber. Motivated by the death of her parents, she wants to give everyone the closure they might not have had with their own loved ones.
