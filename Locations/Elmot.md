# Description
Ancient capital of [[Tarcia]]
Once a thriving metropolis it is now a warren of ruins favored by adventurers, thieves, and outcasts alike. Old customs and new blend as the ruins still thrum with life at the intersection of the current [[Selnor]], [[Ptilmen]], and [[Lortan]] kingdoms. The traditional [[Castor]] masonry houses a collection of black and grey markets in what were once great banquet halls. Principle amongst them is [[Geller’s Floor]]. Positioned in the half standing throne room it is the nexus of the city. Flowing out from there the Tarcian ruins cover an astounding area.

Seen from above the city forms a hand with the base at the inland [[Sea of Persule]]. The finger of the figurative hand are so massive they house individual enclaves. [[Tiamat’s Revenge]] severs the index finger and runs through the palm of the hand as if a fate line. It is said the abyss is where [[Tiamat]] rose from the ground to smite [[Empress Kennits]] and the city.
