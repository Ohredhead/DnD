A small woods part of the [[Misty Forest]];  made and kept safe by the [[Selenian Adventurer’s Guild]]. It acts as a common through road for travelers between parts of the Kindgom.

It cannot be safely traversed at night as the [[Selenian Adventurer’s Guild]] only guards the outskirts of the forest during the night.

For none guild business there is a 10 copper toll person and 5 per beast of burden. Furthermore, merchants pay 5 gold per wagon as this determines the escort size. Though there are plenty of cases where larger escorts could be required based on the nature of the cargo.
