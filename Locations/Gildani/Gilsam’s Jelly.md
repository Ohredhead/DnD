A rather successful preserves business run by [[Gilsam Berryfold]] started in the hamlet [[Gildani]]. The unique berries growing in the [[Mislan Woods]] and greater [[Misty Forest]] have aided in making the unique flavor of the preserves renowned in [[Sintara]] and further afield.

PCs will often find the preserves sold far from their sight of production as merchants coming through [[Gildani]] will buy large quantities hoping to find profits in its resale. It is distinguished by stamped [[Gellen berry]] on the bottom of their jars.
### PC Mission
In the course of discussing the business with [[Gilsam Berryfold]] the PCs can be offered the mission to collect some [[Gellen berry]] in the [[Mislan Woods]]. Likely an [[owlbear]] also interested in the berries will harass the party. ^1306d9
