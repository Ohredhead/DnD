The Gellen berry is a red and dark blue mottled berry that uniquely grows in the [[Mislan Woods]]. Those who taste them are unable to forget the sweet flavor that evokes happy memories.

The berry bush is very particular and can only be harvested under the light of the moon. Else, the berries will take on a bitter and unpleasant taste.
