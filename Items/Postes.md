A system of long distance message transference.

To send a message one simply burns the message paper with the address paper (if needed) and the fee is automatically deducted from the money previously loaded into the Postes.

Postes come in various types. Each has its own range, maximum transfer speed, and possibly other small utilities. They can even be made as a travel item but these are expensive and cost a lot to operate given their none fixed nature and the high level spells an artificer needs to imbue into them.
