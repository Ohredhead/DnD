Tablets made of wood, silver, gold, or other materials that serve official purposes. They have a magic seal stamped on them, carry some details on the issuer, validity period, purpose, and who has the authority of use.

They are almost always paired with a [[Writ of Mater]]. They note the same information but are kept by the issuer and might be marked by the other parties who have the Tablet. This allows cross checking of the information.

Cross checking is easily done with magic ink and using the tablet as a stamp. The paper is then sent via [[Postes]] and can be validated by the issuer.
