## Branches
Their Branches are known as [[Taur]]s after the founding [[Taur]] by [[Liffmæn Gælenflor]].
Other than [[Liffmæn’s Taur]] and a [[Grand Taur]] they house a single discipline. Rarely 2 Taur spring up in a city. However, this is often disastrous as the Taur will often underhandedly and violently compete for limited resources until one capitulates or is subsumed into a [[Grand Taur]].
