# Description
Tiefling druid sorcerer
Despite standing 2 m tall, Ozmar’s light frame gives him an agile stature. He is one of the [[Tizuli twins]]. A gregarious business person, he is a master of conversation, enjoying nothing more than regaling his clients with his tales of adventure or his somehow limitless knowledge of the esoteric and mundane.

He is the face of [[Tizuli's Travelling Tavern]] entertaining guests as the host and barman. While his troop performs he mixes up a whirlwind of cocktails that all have an extra, magical, dimension to them in.

His distaste for Dragonborn is veiled with difficulty, and is widely known by those close to him. However, he might reveal hints of it while under the influence or so might companion that has decided to betray him.
# Appearance
He has two long straight curling horns that join at his brow. His aquamarine skin stands in contrast to his deep purple eyes. They are lightly framed by soft features that make his horns seem almost unwieldy. Two small fangs protrude from his top lip; one of them has a gold tip likely as the result of an old injury. ^2fc609

Elegant metal threads are woven through raven hair and piercings in his horns and ears. On the threads hang little baubles  in the shape of glasses, mixers, and tonics. As a final touch an iridescent rainbow scale link chain hangs around neck adorned by five colored discs with a goblet stamped on them. When he turns his head the headpiece twinkles with beautiful charm. ^784a22
# Notes
- He and his troop are top secret members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Even other ordinary members would not recognize them and high level ones perhaps only by their many monikers.
- His goal is to collect the blood of the [[Cavalar Kings]]. Once he has filled all 5 goblets on the [[Tarcian Headpiece]] he will be able to re-summon [[Tiamat]]
- He is motivated by hatred for those who brought about the death of his family. In particular he blames the Dragon Born, as it was by their hand that his parents were slain.
