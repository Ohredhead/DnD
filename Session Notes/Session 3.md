As [[Arna]] uncovers the opening in the cliff side at the top of [[DnD/Locations/Gildani/Gildani Mine|Gildani Mine]] she looks back at Fontayne and [[Paul Pockets]] in time to see Paul dissaperate into thing air, along with Fontaine’s diamond.

Moving on from their companions odd disappearance the team agree with the dwarves that it is best to head back to [[Gildani]] and rest up before exploring beyond the opening. The dwarves load up the 3 downed dwarves onto a wagon they usually use to transport ore. Before moving out they board up the opening just incase something should come out.

Upon their return to [[Ferite’s Company]] the gang is rewarded with 5 gold each. Fontayne takes Paul’s share.

[[Strongthumb]] gives the sample of fungus to [[Barclow Ironthumb|Barclow]], though the party does not see this.

The 2 remaining members of the party then retire to [[Wheller’s Wheel]]. Here they meet Clarence who they get to know over some ale. He is interested to join them on their return to the mine since he is looking for special kinds of cave dust for a salve.

On the groups return to Gildani Mine they find that the boarded up cave is no longer boarded up.

Out of an abundance of caution Fontayne summons his familiar for the first time to explore. The familiar, [[Steven]], has the form of a bat and flies into the opening to explore the cave first.

When the party believes it is safe they enter and explore. The find the magic circle, a dias on the raised area of the cave, large blue glowing crystals (some partially grey), and a tunnel at the back of the cave. The magic circle is composed of three concentric circles of draconic script (though the party does not know this yet).

Arna uses detect magic and looks around. The dias has lingering magic traces on it, as if something magical had been placed there previously. When she looks at the circle her eyes hurts and she takes psychic damaged. All she she’s a lot of violent energy and the faint sound of screams.

Eventually the party explores the passage way at the back of the cave and find that it ends in another exit to behind the waterfall adjacent to the mine. The entrance was hidden with illusion magic.

They see drag marks and footprints in the mud of the passageway.
