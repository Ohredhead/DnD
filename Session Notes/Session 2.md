Paul was retconned into the story in this session.

Following up on the original offer from [[Ferite’s Company]] Arna and Paul head to their offices in the morning to set of to the mine.

There they meet they again meet the head of the company [[Barclow]]. She introduces them to the head of the dwarves that will accompany them to the mine, [[Strongthumb]], and a young wizard who has picked up a contract from the [[Selenian Adventurer’s Guild]] to help clear the mine.

The get each get a [[Fungal Mask]], a [[Fire Bomb (small)]], and a torch.
The Dwarves accompanying them all have a tower shield, a Fire Bomb (small), torch, and an axe or hammer.

The party accompanies the dwarves to [[DnD/Session Prep/Gildani Mine|Gildani Mine]], about a 2h walk from the town.
There they encounter an fungus infested mine. As they start to clear the mine they are attacked by [[Funganite Stalker]]s, [[Funganite Thrall]]s, and a [[Funganite Mycelimaner]]. 3 of the dwarves go down but none die.

During the battle Fontayne fails to cast his chaos orb and eventually the diamond that functions as its core is recovered by Arna. When she tosses it back to Fontayne. In a moment of greed empowered athleticism Paul Pockets leaps and intercepts the toss, taking the diamond for himself.

The battle ends when the dwarves bash the [[Spore Core]] with their torches. The burned core crumbled and reveled an opening to a cave behind it.

During their time at the mine Strongthumb mentioned that he needed to collect a sample of the fungus to bring back to [[Mandri]].
