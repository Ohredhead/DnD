[[Session 1.canvas|Session 1]]
## Setting
Part of the party walks through outskirts of [[Mislan Woods]] traveling towards [[Gildani]]. ==One of the parties friends== has informed them that the small town is looking for help to clear the [[Gildani Mine]] of a fungal infestation. They have been given a set of [[Fungal Mask]]s to prevent inhalation of the spores.

Another PC is already at this scene of the fire. If they are helping or spectating will depend on their alignment. This could also be 2 PCs as long as they know each other.
## Intro Line
The late afternoon shadows draw across the mossy wood path. It is fortunate for your weary feet that you are but 5 km out from the hamlet of [[Gildani]] at the mouth of the glen.
Your 2 day journey from the city of Sintara has been fairly unremarkable and you sped along the path toward your goal. You have just emerged from the [[Mislan Woods]] crossing and your peculiar party is chatting amiably.
Please describe yourself.
## Hook
The PCs nostrils sting with the acrid burn of smoke coiling through the trees. A quick check of the surroundings will clearly reveal the source of the fumes as an orange hue flickers behind the thicket and trees.
>A keen nose can detect the slight smell of sulfur infused into the smoke cloud. DC: 18 with no prior knowledge, 14 with knowledge : perception (smell). - DM note: [[Yellow Hag Spice]]
## Prep
- [ ] Inform the PC party w/ the masks (PCP1) who has given them the task, what they know about the task and town, what they know about the surrounding area, and have them agree who they are to each other.
- [ ] Discuss with the solo/duo PCs (PCP2) what their motivation for being in the area is and build foundation for why they would want to help the arriving group.
