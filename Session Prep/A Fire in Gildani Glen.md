[[Session 1.canvas|Session 1]]
## Setting
Part of the party walks through outskirts of [[Mislan Woods]] traveling towards [[Gildani]]. ==One of the parties friends== has informed them that the small town is looking for help to clear the [[Gildani Mine]] of a fungal infestation. They have been given a set of [[Fungal Mask]]s to prevent inhalation of the spores.

Another PC is already at this scene of the fire. If they are helping or spectating will depend on their alignment. This could also be 2 PCs as long as they know each other.
## Intro Line
The late afternoon shadows draw across the mossy wood path. It is fortunate for your weary feet that you are but 5 km out from the hamlet of [[Gildani]] at the mouth of the glen.
Your 2 day journey from the city of Sintara has been fairly unremarkable and you sped along the path toward your goal. You have just emerged from the [[Mislan Woods]] crossing and your peculiar party is chatting amiably.
Please describe yourself.
## Hook
The PCs nostrils sting with the acrid burn of smoke coiling through the trees. A quick check of the surroundings will clearly reveal the source of the fumes as an orange hue flickers behind the thicket and trees.
>A keen nose can detect the slight smell of sulfur infused into the smoke cloud. DC: 18 with no prior knowledge, 14 with knowledge : perception (smell). - DM note: [[Yellow Hag Spice]]
## Prep
- [ ] Inform the PC party w/ the masks (PCP1) who has given them the task, what they know about the task and town, what they know about the surrounding area, and have them agree who they are to each other.
- [ ] Discuss with the solo/duo PCs (PCP2) what their motivation for being in the area is and build foundation for why they would want to help the arriving group.
## PCP1 Info
- The mission was given by a member of the [[Selenian Adventurer’s Guild]]. A third party contract allowed to be contracted to non-members.
	- The member is [[Delf Lerzan]], a high level member responsible for many guild contracts and a family friend of the most well connected/noble origin PC.
	- The contract promises ==50 gold==, 10% of which must be paid in dues to the guild.
	- They were provided with [[Fungal Mask]]s and simple wooden [[Tablet of Mater]].
- They know what the fungi are and that there could be a core spore in the mine.
- They also know that the fungi are vulnerable to fire but when hit they will release spores that could infect those without masks on.
- They started their journey from the small city [[Sintara]].
- They know the name of the town mayor, [[Grifford Tolk]], and have a [[Tablet of Mater]] with a guild seal on it to prove their legitimacy and to allow the free passage through the [[Mislan Woods]].
- They are somewhat familiar with the [[Mislan Woods]] as it is a common area to travel through.
## PCP2 Info
- They are fully familiar with the hamlet of [[Gildani]] and the starting layout of the mine as they have passed their.
- They know [[Ferite’s Company]], the dwarf company, that is contracted to manage the mine.
## The Burning Barn
As you step out of the woods you see orange and yellow flames have engulfed the upper part of a large lilac barn. Part of the roof has already collapsed and a group of half foot in chatted clothes have formed a bucket line to a nearby hand water pump. One large half orc helms the water pump.

[[Gilsam Berryfold]], the owner of [[Gilsam’s Jelly]], is directing the activities and trying to get the situation under control.
