========================================================================================================================

> Traveling through the Woods
Arna and Maukrim are traveling together through the Mislan Woods, from Sintara, Capital of the Kingdom of Selnor, to Gildani, a hamlet. Arna had been given a Writ of Matter from the Order of Moradin that tasked her with delivering a set of 8 Fungal Masks to Gildani. The Mayor of the town, Gilford Tolk, on behalf of Ferite's Company, had asked for these masks since in the Mines near Gildani there was a fungal growth that made people sick with infection. The Writ of Matter states that half of the payment is to be provided upon the delivery of those masks to the mayor and the other half by the Selenian Adventuring Guild.

Maukrim had been drifting through the world for some time and agreed to travel with Arna along the path, to satisfy his curiosity. Both travelers were pretty reserved and didn't feel the need to talk much along the way. The path through the forest is safeguarded, during the day, by the Selenian Adventurer's Guild. It's early evening on an day at the end of Autumn. Arna and Maukrim are close to the end of the journey. 

> The Barn
We see a faint orange flicker and smell something burning close to the edge of the woods, outside of the path. There are wisps of white smoke. Arna and Maukrim step out of the path to investigate. When they get to the edge of the woods, they see a large barn engulfed in flames, with it's roof partly collapsed. They also see the town of Gildani not far off. There is a line of halflings forming a bucket line from a pump manned by a Half-Orc to the barn.

Arna approaches the halfling and asks where she can help. The halfling thanks her for the help and mentions there is need for more people in the bucket line and for someone to go ask for more help from the town. Arna decides to go to help in the bucket line and tells Maukrim to go to the town and ask for help. On the way to the town Maukrim meets a group of people led by a man in robes and an ornate floopy hat and asks him for help. The person looks annoyed and replies "I'm coming. I'm here aren't I?" (or something similar). Maukrim follows him to the barn.

Arna is now inside the barn trying to put out the fire as best as possible using the buckets. There are several decanters and tools inside the barn. Inside the barn there are large storages with colored jars. Other halflings are rushing in and out of the barn carrying out jars. The jars have some sort of berry drawn on them. Using the same line that supplies the buckets, Arna starts moving out jars.

The person that Maukrim met on the way arrives next to the barn. He raises a staff and starts chanting something (a spell). The halfling that directed Arna to the bucket line refers to this person as Mandri. Maukrim notices that the man's blue cloak has a design of a large gold tower with a single window on it.

> Lia
At this time Lia is in a small room in Wheller's Wheel, a tavern in Gildani. Wheller's Wheel is a giant patchwork of buildings that surrounds the central square of the town on almost all sides. Due to Gildani's location outside of the Mislan woods and on the way to Sintara, the town is always full of merchants. Lia has been in Gildani for a couple of days where she has made some coin by helping merchants obtain information on their artifacts, as a way to appraise them, but also to give the merchants something to upsell their items for (a good backstory is always good to have when selling rare merchandise). She was now in her room, finishing taking a look at small collection of rings with elvish markings, when she sees, out of her window, an orange blaze on the horizon. 

She decides to leave her room and go downstairs to inquire what is happening. She passes by 2 tavern drinking rooms on the upper floors, full of people drinking and singing. It's only when she reaches the first floor main room that she see' less movement with several people rushing out of the tavern. She approaches the bartender and asks what is happening. The bartender informs her that everyone is rushing out because Gilsam's is on fire and that several halflings have gone to help put out the fire and to help recover the Jams.

Lia decided to follow the people pouring out of the tavern to see the events unfold, but without running or rushing. When she exits the tavern she sees a large group of people going towards a burning barn. She follows and soon approaches the barn in time to see a sphere of water, floating above the barn, crash into the barn, extinguishing the flames. The roof fully caves in and Arna and the halflings inside the barn spew out with the force of the water. Arna is discombobulated but not injured. Gilsam, the halfling woman who had directed Arna to the bucket line, thanks Mandri, the wizard profusely for putting out the flames. Mandri, annoyed, mentions he expects payment in the morning and leaves. Maukrim watches it all unfold, sitting on a rock.

> Gilsam's Jellies
Arna came to and, looking around saw 2 halflings that were inside the barn with her, one seemed fine and the other had one of the beams on top of his broken leg. Arna rushed over and lifted the beam enough for the halfling to remove his leg from under the beam. Arna then cast Cure Wounds on the halfling, who thanked her, introduced himself as Lipworth Halffoot and promised to pay the Acolyte (Arna) a round at the local tavern.

Gilsam, a stocky halfling woman with light blue hair and a ring with the design of a berry, approached Arna and introduced herself as the owner of Gilsam's Jellies, thanked Arna for the help and promised some compensation if Arna were to return the following day.

Meanwhile, Lia has taken advantage of the large gathering of people to inquire with some about sightings of elves from the Silver forest. A gnome mentioned he had made dealings 2 days ago with merchants from the silver forest that passed through Gildani headed in the direction of Cintara. The Gnome did not provide her with much additional information, choosing to keep his reputation as an honest merchant. Lia then decides to head back into town to her room.

> The tavern
Arna and Maukrim watch as the guards of the path return from the Mislan woods, close the path for the night and head to several small guard towers on the outskirts of the forest. They then head into town. They see the big strange building that makes the Wheller's Wheel Tavern, a smithy, the Mayor's house (a small, well kept house with a small tower on its side), and a building with a sign saying "Ferrite's company".

Arna and Maukrim head to the Tavern and sit down to eat. They order food and drink as the tavern quickly fills up with all manner of folk. At this time, Lia decides to come down to eat and finds that the only avilable spot is at a table where 2 other people are already sitting. Irritated, she approaches and asks if she can sit down. Arna says yes and Lia orders food. Maukrim inquires about Lia's ring. Lia mentions she made the ring and it's very dear to her.

Lipworth and a series of other halflings find the party, join the table and and offer a round. He also offers a Jar of Jelly to Arna and Maukrim. Between beers Lipworth mentions that he believes the fires were unnatural, blames the Lizard folk that live in the forest. He mentions that another halfling, Jeremia, said that he say a green figure slinking into the woods moments before the fire broke out. 

Upon realizing that Lia appraises artifacts for a living, Lipworth tells her that Gilsam would like someone to take a look at the firestones in her company to see which ones are still usable and which ones are dangerous, Lia asks for how much that would pay, to which Lipworth said that he would find out and inform her. He also asks her about the magical properties of some rings they had. Lia tells them that the bracelets have no magical properties at all. Lia receives an ale and decides to chugg it, even though it was her first time drinking any alcohol that is not elven wine. The halflings, rush out of the tavern yelling "We will get you Bumbledor, you shifty merchant! For tricking us with your rings!". In conversation, Lia mentions that she's headed to Sintara. Arna mentions that she will also head soon to Sintara, she just needs to deliver the masks and get payment and asks Lia if she wants to go together. Lia agrees and promptly passes out, but not before asking Arna "Are you a man or a woman?". The half orc bartender carries Lia to her bed chambers. Maukrim and Arna stay to finish their drinks and soon follow to their bedrooms. Maukrim climbs to the roof and stays awake looking at the sky.

>The Next day

Arna and Maukrim head down to have breakfast. Mukrim orders a dragon ale. Lia wakes up to her first hangover and on her nightstand there's a glass of water, a flower and a note that says "eat the flower", after eating the flower she feels the hangover disappear and she goes down as well for breakfast. Meeting with Arna and Maukrim, they decide to meet again to head to Cintara after Arna has dropped of the masks.

Arna and Maukrim head to the Mayor's house, while Lia heads back up to rest. When they get to the Mayor's house, they are told to wait. Soon, they meet Gilsam as she leaves the mayor's office, where she met with him regarding the fire. As she leaves, she reminds Arna to go to her office to receive payment for the previous night's help. They meet with the mayor, who receives the masks and offers his part of the payment. He asks the two if they would be interested in helping with sorting out the problem with the fungal growth in the mines, offers 15GP and mentions that they want to try to clear it the day after tomorrow. They say they will consider it. When they leave they see a Dwarf woman enter the office of the Mayor, presumably a member of Ferite's Company to receive the masks. As they head out, Arna explains the concept of Government to Maukrim.

Lia got a note to her bedroom from Gilsam saying that she would offer her 6GP to check the firestones and with directions to where Gilsam's office is located.
