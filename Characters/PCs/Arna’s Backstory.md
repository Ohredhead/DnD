[[Arna]] was born and raised in a small village, nested between mountains. He had an older brother, [[Fonur]], who was 2 years younger than him. His parents had a small house and they lived as peasants. His father worked as a smith and farrier and his mother tended to a vegetable garden and with the help of [[Fonur]] they sold some of those vegetable in the village market. [[Arna]] and [[Fonur]] grew up playing together and getting into trouble, climbing trees and digging holes to look for tresure.

His father taught both [[Arna]] and [[Fonur]] from a young age, how to work in the forge and how to imbue iron and steel with runes and magic. He taught them to pray to the [[Moradin]] to make their tools sharp and their metal strong. He taught them stories of how the [[Dwarves of the Moutain]] prayed to the God and forged golden weapons and mithril armour and jewelry embedded with the most beautiful precious stones. He told them how the [[Moradin]] only appears to those he deems worthy to work in his name and forge and wield the weapons of the God, that it was an honour to be visited by the God. To [[Arna]] these were amazing stories of the bigger world and he wondered how his father knew of them.

One day, when [[Arna]] was 17yo, strange men came to the village. They were "big folk", rode on big horses and wore blood red cloaks. They asked in the town for a dwarven smith. When [[Arna]]'s father, [[Rugon]], heard about it through another villager they ran home and said to his mother "They are here! They found me! They found us! I don't know how, but they found us! We need to leave. Now!"
"Are you sure it's them? They can just be clients."
"There's 3 of them. They always come in 3. And the red cloaks! It's got to be them!"
[[Arna]] overheard this. His parents called him and his brother hurriedly. Their mother, [[Liya]], sat them both down, while their dad went back and forth collecting things and putting them into 4 sachets. She said "Kids, you're both already old enough to understand why we will have to leave this village. We don't have time for the whole story, but: There are men in town that want to take your dad away from us. And they will stop at nothing to achieve it. We must leave and disappear as fast as we can for as long as we can."
"Why do they want dad?" asked [[Fonur]].
Their dad stopped for a second and exchanged a sorrowful look with his wife but said nothing.
"They want him... Because of what he can do... Because of your father's skill as a smith."
They helped their parents pack and were ready to leave when they head a knock on the door.

"[[Rugon]]! [[Liya]]! Are you there? There's some knights here looking for you! They say they want to hire you." The voice sounded uneasy, as if unsure they were doing the right thing, but certain they didn't have a choice.
"It's [[Groph]]." whispered [[Liya]]. "They must have threatened him."
"I hear something" said another voice behind the door. Another knock, this time much stronger. "Open the door, [[Nogur]], or whatever you calla yourself these days."
"Run out the back." Whispered [[Fonur]]. "I'll tell them you're not here."
His mother tried to stop him, but it was too late, [[Fonur]] was closest tot he door and they risked getting everyone killed. [[Rugon]] looked at his son, smiled and whispered back "All right. As soon as they leave run and try to catch up with us. We'll head to the center of the forest. Where I taught you and your brother how to hunt." he then grabbed 3 of the bags plus his son and pushed his wife out the back door. Tears flowed out [[Liya]]'s eyes and she clasped her mouth to muffle the sound. They ran.

They traveled through the woods for 3 days. [[Liya]] hadn't said a word since they left the house. [[Arna]] sat down. "Dad, I'm very tired. Can we stop and rest for a while?"
[[Rugon]] stopped. "We're close to the center of the forest, we can rest but not for long."
They sat down, drank some water and ate some of the provisions they had packed. As they were eating, they heard sounds. A rustle of leaves, a branch snapping. [[Rugon]] took out his battle hammer, a magnificent weapon that the children had seldom seen, it was encrusted with all kinds of gems and runes ran all around it in intricate patterns.  [[Liya]] grabbed her bow and readied an arrow, both covering [[Arna]] with their bodies. From the woods a figure emerged. It was [[Fonur]].

"Mom! Dad! [[Arna]]! You're alright!"
He ran to embrace them, but before he could reach them, there was another movement in the woods, a whistle and then.. Thud. The tip of the arrow pierced his sternum and a red stain became larger and larger on his chest. He stopped. Looked at his family. His mother yelled and cried as she rushed over to her boy. His father stood for a second, unable to comprehend what happened and as the realisation came his face became angry and he rushed behind the body of his son as it lumped forward into his mother's arms. In his last moments he looked at his brother, who had stayed where he was and now had tears in his eyes. As he looked at [[Arna]] he said "Don't be afraid". As he spoke, a stream of blood dripped from his mouth and his eyes became glassy and his body heavy.
[[Liya]] yelled "No! My son! No!".

There was no sight of the attackers at this point. They moved rapidly and silently through the woods. As [[Arna]] looked on his brother's dead body and began to cry, a strong arm picked him up from behind and put a knife to his throat. [[Arna]] yelled and tried to kick him or punch him, but the man was much stronger than him.
A second man in a red cloak rushed from the left and put a sword to his mother's throat before she had time to pick up her bow.
"You're a hard man to track, [[Nogur]]." Said the man holding [[Arna]].
"But he wasn't" the other said as he gestured to [[Fonur]]'s dead body.
[[Arna]] saw his father's expression harden, his grip on his hammer was so strong his knuckles turned white. From behind him a third voice came. "Drop your weapon, Dwarf." The last word was spat with hate. "Or your small family will become even smaller."

The third man's cloak was a darker shade of red and bordered in fine gold.
"18 years we have been searching for you and now we finally found you. You're coming with us. And this time, you're going to finish what you started. No matter how much time it takes."
"I'll go with you willingly, but only if you let my family go." said [[Rugon]]. His eyes flashed a golden light.
The man looked at the other two and nodded. [[Arna]] fell to the ground and ran up to his mother.
The hammer dropped to the floor.

The third man walked up to [[Arna]]'s father, put a hand on his shoulder and said a word [[Arna]] didn't understand. His hand flashed with a dark red light for a moment and big heavy chains appeared out of thin air around [[Rugon]]'s arms, chest and legs.
"Let's get out of here. Move!" said the man pushing [[Rugon]] ahead.
"What about these two?" Asked one of the other 2.
"We got what we came for. Plus, a deal is a deal, right?"
"No, please no!" Yelled Kordur "let him go."
One of the men kicked him in the stomach and laughed.
[[Rugon]] struggled against the chains "Stop! Even in these chains I can take you. If you lay another finer on them, you'll see what I can do." He faced his son and wife "[[Liya]], I'm sorry. Please forgive me. [[Arna]], be strong. You have to be strong, son!"
The men laughed again, pushed [[Rugon]] and disappeared into the forest, the sound of the chains getting fainter and fainter. [[Liya]] sobbed as she held both her boys. [[Arna]] tried to be strong for a while but too cried.

They stayed there for several minutes. Kneeling in the leaves of the forest and crying. [[Liya]] slowly stopped crying. She got up and held [[Arna]]'s hand. They looked at each other and nodded.
Together, they carried [[Fonur]]'s body home and buried it.
[[Liya]] was sat inside with her head in her hands. She didn't have more tears to cry, she didn't know what to do, she didn't know what to say to her son.
That night [[Arna]] stayed mostly awake. He cried at first, but he too found he couldn't cry anymore. He kept remembering the moment his brother's chest filled with blood. And his last words. He fell asleep, close to the dawn.

In his sleep [[Arna]] heard a voice.
"Don't be afraid." it said
"[[Fonur]]? Is that you?" He asked
"Don't be afraid, [[Arna]]." The voice repeated. "I'm not your brother, as he has passed beyond. But I'm here to help you."
"Who are you? Where am I?"
[[Arna]] noticed he was wearing armour. Golden and silver armour, with drawings of battles and runes of protection. He was surprised to see that it fit him like a glove. "I am the [[Moradin]]. And you are back home and asleep."
"How can you help me? My father was taken and my brother is..."
"I can help you by giving you tools and a purpose."
"And what purpose is that?"
"[[Arna]], you are destined to forge and wield great weapons. The armour you dawn right now, you may forge it. I can give you the power and knowledge to do that. And you can use that power and that knowledge to defeat those who wish to use my gifts for evil and protect that which is most important to you."
"Protect/ I was useless today... I should have done something... I should have saved him... Instead I was afraid."
"I can show you how to heal and protect, as well as how to imbue your weapons with unimaginable power." He paused. "I once visited your father. That's why he was able to pass some of his knowledge to you and your brother. That's why he was able to forge the great battle hammer that now lies in the forest. The people that took your father, they wish to use the gifts that I gave him for their own evil purposes. They will torture him if he doesn't. I do not want that to happen. If you are willing, I will give you my gift and with it, you may yet be able to free your father and avenge your brother. Are you willing to stay faithful to me to use these gifts?"
[[Arna]] thought for a second.
"I am."
[[Arna]] woke up, sweating and knew immediately that something changed in him. he went to fetch his father's hammer that had stayed in the forest and put it on the mantle.

[[Arna]] spent the next several months preparing to lave home. Learning as much as he could from prayer, forging and the runic books his father had. He forged his own armor set (not nearly as good as the one he had in the dream, but not bad still).
A year later, when he left home, he took his father's hammer with him. He told his mother that he would find his father and avenge his brother.
[[Arna]] traveled for years trying to find any piece of information about men in red cloaks. Almost no one seemed to know about them (or at least not interested in sharing).
