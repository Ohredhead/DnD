Moradin was the lawful good god of the dwarves and the chief deity in their pantheon. The Soul Forger was strength incarnatemand force of will embodied, a harsh but fair judge who evaluated his creations by the goodness of their works first and intentions second. The Dwarffather inspired dwarven inventions and constantly sought to improve their race, encouraging a good-natured, intelligent, and harmonious existence with other good races while battling their pride and isolationist tendencies.
“Every fall of the hammer on the anvil, every fire stoked in the forge, is a step on a journey set before me by Moradin himself. It isn't work. It is a challenge to achieve greatness.” — Balifra Eversharp
