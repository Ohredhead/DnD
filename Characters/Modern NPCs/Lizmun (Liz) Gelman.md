# Description
Deviant Changeling Rogue
Liz has changed so often they are no longer sure of their original form. Lost in the fey woods at an early age they turned before they can recall. They have three preferred forms: as a androgynous fey, female panther folk tabaxi, and male high elf.

They are the dancer for the Tizuli troop. Accompanied by their [[Kitsnea]] they change form in an almost magical way emerging through light, sound, and smoke. Light handed, Liz, can easily wield a wide array of simple tools, pickpocket, lock pick, or performing simple slight of hand with ease. This enhances their performances and frequently enough helps the troop out of a pinch.
