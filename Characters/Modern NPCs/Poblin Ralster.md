A traveling merchant of mixed repute. Doesnâ€™t directly engage in dark business but also does not ask where wares are sourced. Those who ask too many questions often find themselves on the bad side of unpleasant folk.

Often has elvish wares but due to their dubious providence needs assistance appraising and building a story for his wares.

# Appearance
His round frame is clad in a pinstripe waistcoat straining to be set free. His plain navy or grey trouser and polished shoes do not belie his considerable wealth. However, he wears two little golden gem tear drops, one on either end of his luxurious mustache. Along with his gold trimmed spectacles with ornate elvish designs on the rim and stems one might guess at his deep pockets.

# Items
