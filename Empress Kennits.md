The greatest [[Tarcia]]n empress in history. Ruling for 245y she consolidated her realm from her traitorous brother and then expanded her empire across the [[Kestrin]] continent, save the [[Port of Ilmos]]. Her reign ended with a bloody 50 year war against an invading army of dragons. It is rumored that she fought the infamous dragon queen [[Tiamat]] and ultimately fell to her.

After her death, the [[Kestrin]] continent was left in ruins with dragon overlords fighting each other over fiefdom. Only the great [[Tarcia]]n capital [[Elmot]] was left independent but in shambles.

# Secret Herstory
The [[Tarcian Headpiece]] was actually forged and gifted as part of a contract with the dragon queen [[Tiamat]]. During the wars the crown was fed by the blood of fallen warriors but after the war the dragon queen still demanded blood sacrifice. By refusing the empress caused [[Tiamat]] to unleash her forces on the realm. This spelled [[Tarcia]]'s doom.

The Empress and [[Mandritt]] mages fought the dragon queen badly injuring her but they all ultimately fell. The dragon queen now slumbers under restrictions beneath [[Elmot]].

During the siege of the [[Port of Ilmos]] the Empress negotiated a peace with the great [[Mandritt council of mages]]. In exchange for independence and an end to her conquest the mages agreed to send the [[Broken Battalion]] to help her fight the inevitable wrath of [[Tiamat]].
